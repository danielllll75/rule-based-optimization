Rule-Based Charging Station Optimization

Overview

This repository contains a Python-based rule-based algorithm designed to optimize charging station selection for heavy machinery and portable batteries. The system ranks charging stations based on multiple factors such as cost, distance, and availability, ensuring efficient energy management in real-world scenarios.

Key Features

Loads Three Datasets: The code loads datasets related to heavy machinery, battery containers, and charging stations.

Machine and Battery Selection: Users can select a specific heavy machine and a compatible portable battery.

Charging Station Filtering: The system filters available charging stations based on predefined criteria.

Rule-Based Optimization: A rule-based approach ranks the top five charging stations based on cost, availability, and distance.

Charging Time Calculation: The estimated charging time for the selected machine and battery is computed.

Scenario Analysis: The system evaluates real-world scenarios to validate optimization results.

Energy Demand Calculation: Computes normal and extra energy demand, along with total energy consumption.

How It Works

Load the Datasets: The script imports relevant datasets containing details about heavy machinery, batteries, and charging stations.

User Input: The user selects a heavy machine and an associated battery from the dataset.

Filter Charging Stations: The system filters stations based on availability, location, and energy requirements.

Apply Rule-Based Optimization: The algorithm ranks the best charging stations based on cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency.

Rank Top 5 Charging Stations: The most optimal charging stations are presented in a ranked list.

Charging Time Calculation: The estimated time required to charge both the machine and the battery is computed.

Scenario Analysis: The system examines real-world applications to validate results.

Energy Demand Calculation: The total energy consumption for normal and extra demand scenarios is calculated.

Output Results: The optimized selection and relevant data are displayed for the user.
